- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @christian-impollonia
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in cybersecurity and software engineering
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently undertaking a Master's in Computing Security at Imperial College London
- Have a look at some of the projects I have worked on in the past 4 years at King's College and Imperial!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: christian.impollonia@yahoo.it   or    +447765063925
- All projects in this repository are either my own work or the work of a team I participated in. 
- Not all pieces of code belong to me, this is Academic work done as a student at King's College London and part of the code present here is code that was pre-provided by the university and that I extended. 
- Most of the work is extensively commented to distinguish what was written by me and what wasn't.
